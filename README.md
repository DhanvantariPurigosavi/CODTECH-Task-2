Overview of Student Grade Tracker
Purpose
This project aims to develop a Python program that tracks and manages student grades. It provides an efficient way to store grades for multiple subjects or
assignments, calculate averages, and provide meaningful feedback such as letter grades and GPA. The system is user-friendly and provides clear options for 
data entry, calculation, and summary display.

Features
Add Grades:
    Users can input grades for various subjects or assignments.
    The program ensures grades are valid (e.g., between 0 and 100). 
Calculate Average:
  Computes the average of all grades entered.
  Supports multiple grades per subject.
Grade Classification:
  Converts the average grade into a corresponding letter grade (e.g., A, B, C, D, F).
  Calculates GPA on a 4.0 scale based on the average grade.
Display Summary:
  Displays the calculated average, letter grade, and GPA in a structured format.
  Provides a comprehensive overview of the student's performance.
User Interaction:
  A menu-driven interface allows users to navigate options.
  Options include adding grades, viewing summaries, and exiting the program.

  Technical Details
    Data Storage: Grades are stored in a dictionary with subjects as keys and lists of grades as values.
    Input Validation: Ensures numerical values are entered for grades and restricts invalid inputs.
    Scalability: Supports multiple subjects and assignments without predefined limits.
    Error Handling: Handles invalid user inputs gracefully.
